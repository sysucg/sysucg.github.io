- Choose **one** project to introduce: **The freeglut Project**, **The GLFW Project**.

#### 2.2 Know the State of the Art
SIGGRAPH is one of the most authoritative conference in Computer Graphics. It is also the world’s largest, most influential annual event in computer graphics and interactive techniques. Here([SIGGRAPH ASIA 2016 Courses](http://www.siggraph.org/sites/default/files/siggraph-asia-2016-courses-open-access.html)) are some topics on SIGGRAPH-Asia 2016.
